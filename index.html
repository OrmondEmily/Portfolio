        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <div class="profile">
            <p>
                I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill in May of 2025. Here I received a B.S. in Biology with a Second Major in Geography. 
                During my time here I learned mapping skills in <b>ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, ArcGIS Online, R Studio, Adobe Illustrator, and Leaflet.</b> 
                I've also learned how to think spatially, applying my GIS skills projects focusing on <b>community and environmental based problems.</b> 
                Though these projects I worked in a variety of teams focusing on collaboration, however, also learned how to take initative and complete projects independently. 
                I enjoy visualising data and have a very <b>strong attention to detail</b> which combined with my love for art helps me create visually appealing map layouts. 
                I created this website myself using skills I learned in a webmapping course. 
                Click through my website to learn more about the projects and coursework I completed.
